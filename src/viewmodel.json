      "description": "In a hospital lots of different systems are used and usually they do not work very well together. At the same time systems need to share information with each other and patients and authorities want information regardless of the system that stores the information. To solve this problem we are building a service bus for the county of Västerbotten, based on principles for domain driven architecture, SOA, REST and MicroServices, using .Net and Web API. The service bus handles routing, service discovery and has an engagement index that keeps track of patients and in which system they have data. Although every service is independent of the other a lot of functionality is the same for every service, therefore we created a framework existing of NuGet packages. As part of the project we also build a web portal on top of the service bus that makes the information about the patients accessible for the hospital's employees. In this talk I will discuss the challenges but most important the solutions we are working on to solve those integrations.",

Using extension methods without extension methods, how? How can you get value equality for free? I have a lot of existing C# or VB code. Can I somehow benefit from F#? Finally we will explore tools that you can use to get acquainted with F# scripting and tools which you can use with your existing .NET projects and beyond.",

There are many providers that offer solutions for managing containers for example Google Cloud Platform, Amazon AWS and Mesosphere. This talk will introduce Kubernetes from Google, a orchestration tool that offer automated deployment, scaling and management of your containers. You will learn the core concepts and features of Kubernetes and gain insight in how it differs from similar solutions like Amazon Container Service or Mesosphere. I will also give a live demo of these features. The demo will show how to easily load balance between multiple container instances, auto scale your application and how to do canary releases and rolling upgrades with zero down time.",

      "description": "What is Machine Learning as a Service? Which do I choose? How can I use it in my application? Machine learning has long been a somewhat academic discipline, its practitioners highly specialized. But with the advent of a new class of commoditized machine learning platforms, MLaaS, Machine Learning as a Service, is now available to all developers. MLaaS can be treated as a black box, giving developers the opportunity to dive into machine learning head first. Supply your own data, build a model using tools supported by your chosen MLaaS platform and train it using the well tested algorithms offered. When ready to dig deeper into the world of machine learning, most MLaaS platforms enables us to develop our own algorithms even better tailored to our data and models. This talk will show you the state of the art of MLaaS, what the different vendors offers, and where you best can put it to use in your applications.",

      "description": "In this talk you will learn how to program popular over-the-counter flying mini drones with JavaScript for fun and profit. Well, mostly for fun, but while having fun you can learn JavaScript, node.js, physical computing, Internet of Things and other stuff that surely can be profitable. Cylon.js is a node.js based JavaScript framework for robtics and physical computing. It supports an extensive range of hardware, from remote controlled toys to IoT devices. Cylon.js is great for abstracting away the annoying aspects of hardware coding, leaving the fun part: seeing your code bridge the gap from the digital to the physical world. There might be live coding, and if the demo gods favour us, a live drone show!",
